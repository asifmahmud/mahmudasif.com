Creating Github repo from either remote or locally.


## Two ways of creating a GitHub repository

There are two ways to create a Github repository. One is pushing from local to remote, another is pulling from remote to local.

### 1. Create a repo on Github and Clone it to local
1. Create a repo on Github
2. Go to the project, find a URL 
3. Go to your local folder, run command `git clone URL`

### 2. Create a local repository, push it to your Github account
1. Create a directory to contain the project, go into this directory
2. `git init` to initialise it as a Git Repository
3. Youâ€™ll probably want to create a `.gitignore` file
4. Run `git add .` and `git commit -m ""`
5. Go to your Github page,  create a new repository, select **Push an existing repository**, get your **repo address**
6. In your local, run `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo`
7. Push your code: `git push origin YOUR_BRANCH` 

### 3. Configure remote url

```bash

# works without internet
$ git config --get remote.origin.url 

# works with internet
$ git remote show origin
```
