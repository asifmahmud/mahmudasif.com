I have no idea. It takes efforts.


## Background

I started programming since 2014 but my Java experience is only about two and half years. Recently I decided to get my java certificated by Oracle. 

There're two steps to become Oracle Certificated Professional Java Programmer. [OCAJP](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-808) is the first step. Since it's simple, I set my goal to get 100% score.

## Study Guide

I use the study guide " ", you can find it at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OCA-Certified-Associate-Programmer-1Z0-808/dp/1118957407). It's about 450 pages, only 400 pages are usful in my opinion. And it has some minor errors, you should find them out during the study. I leart it two times and made some notes.

## Time Spend

This process took me about 2 weeks, 4 hours during work days and 8 hours on weekends. I also published some [blogs](https://mossgreen.github.io/tags/#ocajp) about this.

## Result

My goal was 100% pass, but I didn't achieve it, although got a decent score. So I have to say, if you want to get a 100%, there is no easy way. 

## Advices

1. Don't skip details
2. Do some mock up tests if possible. I didn't do it but people said it's helpful
